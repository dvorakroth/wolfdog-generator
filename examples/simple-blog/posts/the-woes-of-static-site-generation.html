  Generating your own static website should, in theory, be a simple enough
  endeavor. There really isn't much to do, all things considered, is there?
  Write your posts in some kind of markup format like HTML or Markdown, inject
  them into a template, and generate a list of your posts in HTML and RSS. If
  you're clever, you might even include a JSON or Atom feed, though the heyday
  of these kinds of technologies is, unfortunately, long gone by now.

  But to anyone who might attempt this, it quickly becomes all too apparent,
  that the market at this moment is saturated with overkill solutions that try
  to do everything, and in doing that, in fact, end up doing nothing. Far too
  many of them rely on web frameworks such as React or Vue, which, respectfully,
  go well above and beyond what is necessary for my use case here; most of them
  pull an absurd number of dependencies from package repositories; and far too
  often, the resulting code is an obfuscated, illegible mess.

  Now, sure, if I was leading the IT department of a small company, and was
  tasked with choosing a static site generator fit for a corporate landing page,
  I would not doubt have chosen one of those existing solutions, for more
  reasons than one. But this here, this ain't your average corporate landing
  page. This is my personal pride and joy, where I go to scribble my thoughts
  and feelings, where I hand-craft every tag and every attribute of HTML. This
  is no place for that.

  Wolfdog Generator is meant to be simple, stupid, and straightforward, and will
  always output non-obfuscated HTML that your nerdy visitors will love to
  View-Source; it tries to be as immune to NPM drama as reasonably possible by
  pulling as few dependencies as reasonably feasible; and best of all, it's
  named after a cutesy patootsey animal. What's not to like?

    Well, unless it doesn't fit your use case I guess. And then there's a whole
    bunch not to like.
